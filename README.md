# rusty-router
A network router written in rust.

This is my first real-world application of Rust.  I mainly use Java and C++ today.  I am looking at Rust to replace my need for C++ as I have noticed I can develop faster in Rust.

I chose to implement a router as I have a passion for Routing Protocols.  Routing was my first real exposure to a large scale distributed systems.  I spent most of my time on monolithic systems before this.  I still see many of the concepts baked into RFCs from decades ago being applied as *new* techniques today.
